@Gokuzomd,"I’m just going to sleep, and I got that video. Literally, he just provides a good structure for learning English. If someone genuinely wants to learn. Follow this Structure. I’m not giving you guarantee like after following this 90 Days Challenge, You’ll be a native speaker. But, for sure you’ll learn lots of things."
@abdurehmanqureshi2359,"1:24 - 2:12 Starting prompt - ""Hey GPT - I am a student trying to learn how to speak English. For the next 90 days, I will use your help to understand the fundamentals of English speaking and will need your help to make me get better."" Is that ok?

2:13 - 4:55 Week 1 - become comfortable with English by questioning and answering simple sentences. Make ChatGPT your English speaking friend who is on the same stage of learning English as you are. Give this prompt to ChatGPT, ""For the week 1, I want to use you as a friend who also does not know how to speak fluently in English. So we will pretend to speak to each other in simple English langauge. Where I will ask you questions and you will answer them in proper English, even if it is not complete. ""

4:56 - 10:49 Week 2 - Give this prompt to Chatgpt ""For this second week, I will listen to English content. Only audio, and then I wilk try to write what I understood, in English and share it with you. You have to give me feedback on my grammar and what I could do better."" Now listen as much English content as you can and write its summaries and ask for feedback from chatgpt and make yourself better.

10:50 - 12:34 Week 3 - Same excercise as Week 2 but now with reading content. Read online articles, English newspaper, blogs, etc. Give this prompt to ChatGPT, ""In this week 3, I will be reading English content instead of listening and will share with you a summary of what I understood. I want you to give me feedback on it in simple English.""

12:36 - 16:44 Week 4 - In this week you will speak English instead of reading or listening it. You can appoint one of your friend or any of your family member to do this practice with you. You can also use some apps like, tandem, HelloTalk, Josh Talk English speaking app, etc. Give this prompt to ChatGPT, ""In this week, I will try and have a real life conversation with someone who is also not a native English speaker. Then I will come back to you to seek help on how to improve my talk to someone.""

16:45 - 19:24 Day 31 to 45 (15 days) - In these days you will increase your foundation of English language learning. You will summarise all of your previous learnings from ChatGPT and ask for any doubt or clarity and will make yourself doubt free. Like you can ask for the difference between who and whom, difference between effect and affect.

19:25 - 21:11 Day 46 to 60 (15 days) - In these days you will work on a difficult part, yes, pronounciation. Asses yourself that what words are thoses whose pronounciation you don't know. Don't use ChatGPT in this process,instead use Google.

21:12 - 22:25 Day 61 to 75 (15 days) - In these days you will finally dive into the real world. You will go on online forums, social media apps, comment on people's posts, posting your own content, giving feedback to other content creators, doing live debates, etc. But you are not alone, you have ChatGPT by your side. You can ask for assistance anytime anywhere.

22:26 - 24:36 Day 76 to 90 (Last 15 days) - In these days, you will finally finally finally challenge yourself and start indulging in conversations with a native English speaker, one who has learned to speak English since he was born, the one whose English speaking skills are top notch and crisp. You will get scared while talking to him but it's the real challenge.

That was all, I hope it saved your alot of time. Before leaving this messege behind I want you to give me sincerest feedback on my English skills. I am 16 years old and doing O level. Thanks alot"

Warna english mai rules fix nahi hai itne exceptions hai.ekdum unscientific language hai. Jabki hindi fix hai na iski grammar k rules fix hai. Jo likho wahi bola jata hai.  Russian japanses chinese jab english nahi bol pate to unka desh itna develop kaise kar gaya hai.

@_forreal,"I never knew ChatGpt could this helpfuI. Thank you sir for introducing something creative from free resources available at our home. I found this video very helpful with some unique techniques which may improve our english for sure if one is willing to. This video is a great help for students like us. I'm still thinking of having a real life day to day english conversation so I can improve my speaking English. 

❤"
@aasthajais.1731,This can't be possible for those who are unable to pay for premium bcz tgere are the limitation of few messages that youcan ask to chatgpt assistant afte the completion of those messeages you have nothing to do on this platform. ....so for me this video is just useless.........

@sirishapativada4656,"Week 1 - wrtie/ share your thoughts/ ask questions to chat gpt in simple language
 Eg: how was your day? Etc
Week2 - listen to a podcast & share it in text with gpt. Ask for grammatical mistakes, corrections and feedback
Week3 - read some article or blog or any, share what you understood to gpt & get feedback
Week 4 - have real life conversation , take gpt help for phrases, idioms etc
Week 5&6 - ask random questions / doubts. Improve your vocabulary 
Week 7&8 - pronunciation (do it in google as gpt replies in only text) 
Week 9&10- discuss with other, record video/audio in english
Week 11&12 - talk to native speakers or with friends& family who can speek fluent English

Do it for atleast 15min a day for 90 days"
